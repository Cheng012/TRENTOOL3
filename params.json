{"name":"Trentool3","tagline":"Transfer Entropy Toolbox, Open-Source MATLAB toolbox","body":"# TRENTOOL3\r\nThe **Tr**ansfer **En**tropy **Too**lbox, an Open-Source MATLAB toolbox for transfer entropy estimation, Reference: [Lindner et al. (2011)](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/12/119).\r\n\r\nTRENTOOL is an open-source MATLAB toolbox that allows the user to easily handle the considerable complexity of transfer entropy (TE) estimation from time series. For the use with neural data TRENTOOL seamlessly\r\nintegrates with the popular [FieldTrip toolbox](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/).\r\n\r\nTRENTOOL provides the following features:\r\n* Transfer entropy estimation \r\n* Reconstruction of interaction delays \r\n* Time-resolved transfer entropy estimation\r\n* Group analysis and statistics\r\n* Partial correction for multivariate interactions\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\nTRENTOOL is implemented in Mathworks MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, 2008) with some functions written in NVIDIA CUDA C/C++ code (NVIDIA Corporation, 2013). TRENTOOL also makes use of the MATLAB toolboxes FieldTrip and [TSTOOL](http://www.dpi.physik.uni-goettingen.de/tstool/). The user interacts with TRENTOOL through MATLAB scripts (.m-files).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
